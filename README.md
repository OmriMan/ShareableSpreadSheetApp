Our GUI support:
1. Load – the user enters the URL address of the file he wants to load, and by clicking
the "Load" control - the file will load and be displayed in the center of the screen.
2. Clear – by clicking the clear button - the display screen will remove the loaded file.
And will again display an empty start screen.
3. Get Cell - the user will enter the details – the indexes of the row and the column of
the wanted cell (In X,Y format). And by clicking on the "Get Cell" control - if the input
is valid the value of the cell will be displayed, otherwise an error message will be
displayed.
4. Set Cell - the user will enter the details - the indexes of the row and column of the
wanted cell, and the value he wants to enter into the cell (in formats V, X, Y). And by
clicking on the "set cell" control - if the details are valid the table that displayed in
the center of the screen will be updated, and informative message about the
changes will display, otherwise an error message will be displayed.
